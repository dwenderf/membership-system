## Business Logic

### Season Management
- **Fiscal year**: Starts September 1st
- **Fall/Winter Season**: Sept 1 - Feb 28/29
- **Spring/Summer Season**: March 1 - Aug 31
- **Flexible architecture**: Easy to modify season structure in future

### Membership & Registration Flow
1. User attempts to register for team/event category
2. System checks if category requires specific membership type
3. If membership required: check if user has valid membership covering season dates
4. If no valid membership: redirect to purchase membership (monthly/annual options)
5. If has valid membership: proceed with registration only
6. Apply current pricing tier based on date
7. Apply discount codes if provided
8. Process payment through configured provider
9. Send confirmation emails

### Membership Model
- **Flexible Duration**: Users purchase memberships for custom time periods
- **Membership Types**: Different levels (Full Hockey, Social, Youth, etc.)
- **Pricing Options**: Monthly rate or discounted annual rate
- **Validity Periods**: Memberships cover specific date ranges, not seasons
- **Multi-Season Coverage**: Annual memberships can cover multiple seasons automatically

### Pricing Tiers Logic
- **Current price = most recent tier** where `starts_at <= NOW()`
- **No end times** to prevent gaps/overlaps
- **Pre-sale tiers** require access codes
- **Example**: Pre-sale (Sept 1) → Early (Sept 15) → Normal (Oct 1) → Late (Nov 1)

### Discount System
- **Multi-use codes** (unlimited usage)
- **Per-user, per-season caps** (resets each season)
- **Percentage-based** with maximum amounts
- **Usage tracking** for admin reports
- **Accounting codes** for financial integration

### Waitlist Management
- **Admin-only visibility** of waitlists
- **Automatic waitlist join** when registration full
- **Admin generates bypass codes** for waitlisted users
- **Single-use bypass codes** remove user from waitlist
- **Position tracking** in queue

## Key Integrations

### Stripe Payment Processing
- Payment intents for secure processing
- Webhook handling for status updates
- Refund management through admin interface
- Metadata tracking for accounting

### Loops.so Email Automation
- Event-triggered emails (registration, payments, etc.)
- Contact property synchronization
- Template management
- Delivery and engagement tracking

### Accounting System Integration
- Accounting codes on registrations and discount codes
- Payment export capabilities
- Revenue reporting by category

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Passwordless system reduces attack surface
- OAuth integration with Google/Apple
- Magic link token expiration and single-use
- Login attempt tracking and rate limiting

### Data Protection
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
- Admin role-based access control
- Payment data encrypted via Stripe
- Audit trails for sensitive operations

### Compliance
- Email delivery tracking for compliance
- Payment history preservation
- User consent management
- Data retention policies

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

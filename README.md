### 4. Template Management Guidelines

**üö® IMPORTANT:** When adding new email functionality to the application:

1. **Add the email event type** to `EMAIL_EVENTS` in `src/lib/email-service.ts`
2. **Create the email function** (e.g., `sendRegistrationConfirmation()`)
3. **Add environment variable** for template ID (e.g., `LOOPS_REGISTRATION_TEMPLATE_ID`)
4. **Update this README.md** with template setup instructions and data variables
5. **Test the email** with sample data to ensure all variables work correctly

This ensures all email templates are properly documented and maintainable.

### 5. Testing Email Integration

1. Complete the Loops setup above
2. Make a test membership purchase in your application
3. Check the `email_logs` table in Supabase to verify delivery status
4. Confirm the email was received with proper variable substitution

## Error Monitoring Setup (Sentry)

The application uses Sentry for error monitoring and alerting, particularly for critical payment issues where payments succeed but database operations fail.

### 1. Create Sentry Project

1. **Sign up** at [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. **Create Organization** (if needed)
3. **Create one Next.js project:**
   - `membership-system` - Single project using environments

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

**Both Development & Production:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
SENTRY_ORG=your_sentry_org
SENTRY_PROJECT=membership-system
```

The system automatically uses `NODE_ENV` to separate development and production events into different environments within the same project.

### 3. Critical Error Scenarios Monitored

The system automatically captures and alerts on:

- **Payment succeeded but membership creation failed** - Critical business issue
- **Database connection failures during payment processing**
- **Email delivery failures after successful purchases**
- **Stripe API errors and timeout issues**

### 4. Alert Configuration

**Development Environment**: Minimal alerts for testing
**Production Environment**: 
- Email/Slack notifications for critical errors
- Real-time monitoring of payment inconsistencies
- Performance tracking for payment operations

### 5. Testing Error Monitoring

1. **Test with payment failure cards** to verify error capture
2. **Check Sentry dashboard** for error events
3. **Verify alert notifications** are working properly

## Testing the Payment System

The application uses Stripe in test mode for development. Use these test card numbers to simulate different scenarios:

### Test Credit Card Numbers

#### **Successful Payments:**
- **Visa**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Visa (debit)**: `4000 0566 5566 5556`
- **Mastercard**: `5555 5555 5555 4444`
- **American Express**: `3782 822463 10005`

#### **Payment Failures:**
- **Generic decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Insufficient funds**: `4000 0000 0000 9995`
- **Lost card**: `4000 0000 0000 9987`
- **Stolen card**: `4000 0000 0000 9979`
- **Expired card**: `4000 0000 0000 0069`
- **Incorrect CVC**: `4000 0000 0000 0127`
- **Processing error**: `4000 0000 0000 0119`

#### **For All Test Cards:**
- **Expiry Date**: Use any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
- **CVC**: Use any 3-digit number (e.g., `123`)
- **ZIP Code**: Use any 5-digit number (e.g., `12345`)

### Testing Different Scenarios

1. **Successful Purchase**: Use `4242 4242 4242 4242` to test the complete flow and email delivery
2. **Payment Failure**: Use `4000 0000 0000 0002` to test error handling and user notifications
3. **Email Delivery**: Check your `email_logs` table in Supabase after each test
4. **Toast Notifications**: Verify success/error messages appear correctly

### Stripe Link Testing

The application supports Stripe Link for one-click payments:
- Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` with email `test@example.com`
- Complete the first purchase to set up Link
- Subsequent purchases will offer one-click Link payments

## Xero Accounting Integration

The system includes automatic Xero integration for seamless accounting and bookkeeping.

### Setting Up Xero Integration

#### 1. Create Xero Developer App

1. Go to [Xero Developer Portal](https://developer.xero.com/)
2. Sign in with your Xero account
3. Create a new app with these settings:
   - **App Type**: Web app
   - **App Name**: "Hockey Association Membership System"
   - **Company/Application URL**: Your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
   - **OAuth 2.0 redirect URI**: 
     - Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/xero/callback`
     - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/xero/callback`
   - **Scopes**: 
     - `accounting.transactions` - Create and manage invoices
     - `accounting.contacts` - Create and manage contacts
     - `accounting.settings` - Read chart of accounts
     - `offline_access` - Refresh tokens

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
XERO_CLIENT_ID=your_xero_client_id_here
XERO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_xero_client_secret_here
XERO_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/xero/callback
XERO_SCOPES=accounting.transactions accounting.contacts accounting.settings offline_access
```

#### 3. Connect to Xero

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in as an admin user
3. Navigate to `/admin/xero-integration`
4. Click "Connect to Xero" and authorize the integration
5. Your Xero organization will now be connected

#### 4. Xero Setup Recommendations

**Chart of Accounts Setup:**
- `MEMBERSHIP` - Membership revenue account
- `REGISTRATION` - Registration revenue account  
- `DONATION` - Donation revenue account
- `STRIPE` - Stripe bank account for deposit tracking
- `STRIPE_FEES` - Expense account for processing fees
- `DISCOUNT-SCHOLAR` - Scholarship discount tracking
- `DISCOUNT-BOARD` - Board member discount tracking

**Bank Account Configuration:**
- Set up your Stripe account in Xero's bank accounts
- Use account code `STRIPE` for automatic payment recording

### How Xero Integration Works

#### Automatic Sync Process

1. **Payment Completed** ‚Üí Stripe webhook triggers auto-sync
2. **Contact Creation** ‚Üí User automatically added as Xero contact
3. **Invoice Generation** ‚Üí Detailed invoice created with line items:
   - Membership purchases
   - Registration fees
   - Donations (if applicable)
   - Discount codes (as negative line items)
4. **Payment Recording** ‚Üí Net payment recorded (gross amount minus Stripe fees)
5. **Fee Tracking** ‚Üí Stripe processing fees optionally recorded as expenses

#### Manual Sync Operations

The admin interface provides manual sync options:

- **Sync Contacts** - Create Xero contacts for all users who have made payments
- **Sync Invoices** - Create invoices for all completed payments  
- **Record Payments** - Record Stripe payments in Xero for existing invoices

#### Financial Benefits

‚úÖ **Automated Bookkeeping** - Eliminates manual invoice entry
‚úÖ **Accurate Fee Tracking** - Stripe processing costs automatically recorded
‚úÖ **Professional Invoicing** - Uses Xero's templates and delivery system
‚úÖ **Real-time Sync** - Financial data synchronized immediately
‚úÖ **Discount Transparency** - Clear breakdown of promotional pricing
‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Complete transaction history and error logging

#### Contact Management & Conflict Resolution

**Xero Contact Constraints:**
- ‚úÖ **Unique Names Required**: Xero enforces unique contact names
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Duplicate Emails Allowed**: Xero permits multiple contacts with same email address

**Our Contact Strategy:**
1. **Member ID Integration**: All users are assigned unique member IDs (e.g., 1001, 1002)
2. **Naming Convention**: Contacts created as "First Last - MemberID" (e.g., "David Wender - 1001")
3. **Archived Contact Handling**: When encountering archived contacts, we create new contacts instead of unarchiving (respects the archival decision)
4. **Name Conflict Resolution**: If name conflicts occur, timestamp is added in parentheses: "David Wender - 1001 (43423)"

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Guaranteed Uniqueness**: Member ID ensures no naming conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Easy Identification**: Member number visible in Xero contact name
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Clear tracking when multiple contacts needed for same person
- ‚úÖ **Archive Respect**: Doesn't override business decisions to archive contacts

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Token Expired**: Tokens refresh automatically, but you can reconnect manually (refresh tokens expire after 60 days)
- **Sync Failures**: Check the sync logs in the admin interface for detailed error messages
- **Missing Invoices**: Use the bulk sync feature to catch up on historical data
- **Account Codes**: Discount codes and memberships will use default codes if not configured
- **Archived Contacts**: System automatically creates new contacts when encountering archived ones

**Error Monitoring:**
- All sync operations are logged to Sentry for monitoring
- Detailed sync logs available in admin interface
- Failed syncs don't affect payment processing

### Testing Xero Integration

1. **Use Xero Demo Company** for testing (recommended)
2. **Complete a test purchase** to verify the full sync workflow
3. **Check Xero** for created contact, invoice, and payment
4. **Verify sync status** in admin interface
5. **Test bulk sync** features with historical data

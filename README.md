### 4. Template Management Guidelines

**üö® IMPORTANT:** When adding new email functionality to the application:

1. **Add the email event type** to `EMAIL_EVENTS` in `src/lib/email-service.ts`
2. **Create the email function** (e.g., `sendRegistrationConfirmation()`)
3. **Add environment variable** for template ID (e.g., `LOOPS_REGISTRATION_TEMPLATE_ID`)
4. **Update this README.md** with template setup instructions and data variables
5. **Test the email** with sample data to ensure all variables work correctly

This ensures all email templates are properly documented and maintainable.

### 5. Testing Email Integration

1. Complete the Loops setup above
2. Make a test membership purchase in your application
3. Check the `email_logs` table in Supabase to verify delivery status
4. Confirm the email was received with proper variable substitution

## Error Monitoring Setup (Sentry)

The application uses Sentry for error monitoring and alerting, particularly for critical payment issues where payments succeed but database operations fail.

### 1. Create Sentry Project

1. **Sign up** at [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. **Create Organization** (if needed)
3. **Create one Next.js project:**
   - `membership-system` - Single project using environments

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

**Both Development & Production:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
SENTRY_ORG=your_sentry_org
SENTRY_PROJECT=membership-system
```

The system automatically uses `NODE_ENV` to separate development and production events into different environments within the same project.

### 3. Critical Error Scenarios Monitored

The system automatically captures and alerts on:

- **Payment succeeded but membership creation failed** - Critical business issue
- **Database connection failures during payment processing**
- **Email delivery failures after successful purchases**
- **Stripe API errors and timeout issues**

### 4. Alert Configuration

**Development Environment**: Minimal alerts for testing
**Production Environment**: 
- Email/Slack notifications for critical errors
- Real-time monitoring of payment inconsistencies
- Performance tracking for payment operations

### 5. Testing Error Monitoring

1. **Test with payment failure cards** to verify error capture
2. **Check Sentry dashboard** for error events
3. **Verify alert notifications** are working properly

## Testing the Payment System

The application uses Stripe in test mode for development. Use these test card numbers to simulate different scenarios:

### Test Credit Card Numbers

#### **Successful Payments:**
- **Visa**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Visa (debit)**: `4000 0566 5566 5556`
- **Mastercard**: `5555 5555 5555 4444`
- **American Express**: `3782 822463 10005`

#### **Payment Failures:**
- **Generic decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Insufficient funds**: `4000 0000 0000 9995`
- **Lost card**: `4000 0000 0000 9987`
- **Stolen card**: `4000 0000 0000 9979`
- **Expired card**: `4000 0000 0000 0069`
- **Incorrect CVC**: `4000 0000 0000 0127`
- **Processing error**: `4000 0000 0000 0119`

#### **For All Test Cards:**
- **Expiry Date**: Use any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
- **CVC**: Use any 3-digit number (e.g., `123`)
- **ZIP Code**: Use any 5-digit number (e.g., `12345`)

### Testing Different Scenarios

1. **Successful Purchase**: Use `4242 4242 4242 4242` to test the complete flow and email delivery
2. **Payment Failure**: Use `4000 0000 0000 0002` to test error handling and user notifications
3. **Email Delivery**: Check your `email_logs` table in Supabase after each test
4. **Toast Notifications**: Verify success/error messages appear correctly

### Stripe Link Testing

The application supports Stripe Link for one-click payments:
- Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` with email `test@example.com`
- Complete the first purchase to set up Link
- Subsequent purchases will offer one-click Link payments

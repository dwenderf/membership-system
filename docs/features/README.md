# Features Documentation

This directory organizes all feature-related documentation into three categories:

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `/completed/`
Features that have been fully implemented and merged to the main branch.

Each completed feature document includes:
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **PR Number**: Link to the pull request where it was implemented
- **Date**: When the feature was completed

**Current completed features:**
- [Accounting Code Autocomplete](./completed/accounting-code-autocomplete.md) - PR #9 (Oct 27, 2025)
- [Timezone Configuration](./completed/timezone-configuration.md) - PR #8 (Oct 27, 2025)
- [Waitlist Management System](./completed/waitlist-feature.md) - PR #5 (Oct 15, 2025)
- [Vercel Pro Migration](./completed/vercel-pro-migration.md) - PR #2 (Jul 18, 2025)

### `/planning/`
Features that are actively being planned or are next in the development pipeline.

These documents typically include:
- Requirements and problem statements
- Proposed solutions and architecture
- Implementation steps
- Testing considerations

**Current planning features:**
- [Payment Refactor Proposal](./planning/payment-refactor-proposal.md)
- [Payment Submission Tracking Enhancement](./planning/payment-submission-tracking-enhancement.md)

### `/deferred/`
Features that have been proposed but are currently on hold or not scheduled for implementation.

These may be revisited in the future based on:
- Changing business requirements
- User feedback
- Technical constraints being resolved

**Current deferred features:**
- [Xero Keep-Alive System](./deferred/xero-keep-alive.md)

## 🔄 Workflow

When working on features, documents typically flow through these stages:

1. **Planning** → Create a new document in `/planning/` with requirements and proposed solution
2. **Implementation** → Feature is developed and merged via pull request
3. **Completed** → Document is moved to `/completed/` with PR number and completion date added

If a feature is decided to be no longer needed or postponed indefinitely:
- Move to `/deferred/` with explanation of why it was deferred

  Architecture Decisions

  1. Payment Method Requirement: Users must have payment method before joining to enable automatic charging
  2. Position Hiding: Don't show position to users to reduce anxiety
  3. Atomic Operations: Payment and registration creation happen together
  4. Webhook Pattern: Follows alternate selection pattern for consistency
  5. Price Override: Stored in registration_fee field, not amount_paid
  6. Accounting Integrity: Discount codes maintain separate accounting codes even with override

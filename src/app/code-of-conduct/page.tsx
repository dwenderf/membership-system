                The Hockey Association Code of Conduct is the organization's statement of expected behavioral standards that all players are required to read, understand, and follow. The Code of Conduct reflects the association's goals, clarifying player responsibilities for actions on and off the ice, while traveling, and through social media. It ensures a fair process for holding members accountable for standards violations.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Sportsmanship is defined as fairness and respect for one's opponent, and graciousness in winning or losing.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Members can report Code of Conduct violations to the association leadership through the system or via email communication.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Leadership will investigate complaints, potentially designating another officer or member to do so. They may also initiate investigations independently.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The investigation typically involves fact-finding and providing notice and response opportunities to the reported individual.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Leadership determines sanctions for Code of Conduct violations at its sole discretion. Potential consequences include:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li>Warnings</li>

                <li>Removal from teams</li>
                <li>Suspension of association membership</li>
                <li>Expulsion from the association</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Leadership considers the member's overall conduct and past violations when determining sanctions. Decisions are not appealable and typically require leadership consensus.
